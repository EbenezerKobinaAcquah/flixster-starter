### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

React hooks for sure

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

Maybe a link to the movie itself?

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My demo presentation didn't go as planned. I had changed a variable in a file in my code and didn't change it everywhere else.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.
